# My Game Collection
As a tech-enthusiast, I was always curious about what went on at the back-end of each game I played as a kid. 
Hence, this repository is a culmination of my long-standing curiosity and passion for game development.
Each game is a standalone project demonstrating various aspects of game development, including graphics, sound, and user interaction.
